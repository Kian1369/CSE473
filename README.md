# CSE473 (Introduction To AI Fall 2023, taught by Hannah Haji Shirazi at the University of Washington)
In this repository, I am going to implement some code for "The Pac-Man projects" which were initially developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.






# My Implemented Assignments:

Project 1: Search in Pacman (23/25)

Project 2: MultiAgent Pacman (25/25)

Project 3: MDPs & RL 

Project 4: HMM & Particle Filtering
